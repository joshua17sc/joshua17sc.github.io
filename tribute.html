      <h2 id="headline">Marcus Aurelius is most remembered for his reign and his personal philosophy which he recorded in <u>Meditations</u>:</h2>
      <p>The more we value things outside our control, the less control we have.</p>
      <p>The best answer to anger is silence.</p>
      <p>The first step: Don’t be anxious. Nature controls it all.</p>
      <p>The second step: Concentrate on what you have to do. Fix your eyes on it. Remind yourself that your task is to be a good human being; remind yourself what nature demands of people. Then do it, without hesitation, and speak the truth as you
        see it. But with kindness. With humility. Without hypocrisy.</p>
      <p>To love only what happens, what was destined. No greater harmony.</p>
      <p>Today I escaped anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions – not outside.</p>
      <p>Objective judgement, now, at this very moment. Unselfish action, now, at this very moment. Willing acceptance, now, at this very moment – of all external events. That’s all you need.</p>
      <p>How ridiculous and how strange to be surprised at anything which happens in life.</p>
      <p>You’re subject to sorrow, fear, jealousy, anger and inconsistency. That’s the real reason you should admit that you are not wise.</p>
      <p>Almost nothing material is needed for a happy life, for he who has understood existence</p>
